Exploratory Data Analysis: Superstore Sales Performance
---
Business Overview

Retail management needs to understand how sales and profitability evolve over time, how performance differs across regions and categories, and which products drive profit consistently.
This project uses exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns, compare segments, and identify actionable insights using historical Superstore sales data.
***
Objectives

The analysis was structured based on three core business questions:
- How do sales trend over time, and are there recurring seasonal patterns?
- How does sales performance vary across regions and product categories?
- Which products contribute the most to profitability, and how does this change by segment?

EDA Approach & Visual Analysis

1️⃣ Sales Trend Analysis

Question: Are sales growing over time, and do certain months consistently outperform others?

Method:
- Aggregated sales across 2014–2017 at a monthly level
- Used a line chart to explore overall sales growth and seasonal fluctuations
- Added a time slicer (Jan 2014 – Dec 2017) to isolate specific periods

Key Insight:
- Sales show a clear upward trend over the four-year period, indicating business growth.
- Certain months consistently exhibit higher sales spikes, suggesting seasonality that could be leveraged for promotions and inventory planning.

2️⃣ Regional & Category Performance Comparison

Question: Which regions and product categories are driving sales, and where are underperforming areas?

Method:
- Compared sum of sales across regions (x-axis) and product categories (clustered columns)
- Enabled slicers for Region and Category to support comparative analysis

Key Insight:
- Sales performance varies significantly by region and category.
- Some categories perform strongly in specific regions but underperform in others, highlighting opportunities for region-specific product strategies.

3️⃣ Profitability & Product-Level Exploration

Question: Which products generate the highest profit, and how they differs according to region and category?

Method:
- Ranked products by sum of profit
- Displayed Top 5 products using a horizontal bar chart
- Dynamic filtering via Region and Category slicers

Key Insight:
- Top profitable products are not static; they change depending on region and category selection.
- This suggests profitability is influenced not just by the product itself, but by market context, reinforcing the need for localized product strategies.
